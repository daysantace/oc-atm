# OC-ATM (ATM module)
The ATM module for OC-ATM.<br>
The ATM manages financing on a client level, it sends information to the server and receives back information to retrieve and deposit money.<br>
This is not to be confused with the till module, which is to transfer money from the card to the linked account for the till.<br>
Note that the ATM module requires an existing server module in the same world (same dimension if you do not use the linked card component) to function.<br>

## Installation
Note that, while not needed for the functioning for OC-ATM itself, you need a computer with an internet card to copy.<br>
You will also need a disk drive.<br><br>

On OpenOS (or the terminal on MineOS), enter the following command.<br>
```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daysantace/oc-atm/atm/main.lua```<br>
Then, run main.lua.
